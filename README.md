Care-Buddy is a Web based application used for healthcare that is a three-in-one medical prediction System 
(Covid-19, pneumonia and Alzheimer). We know the future is all about AI so here is Our idea of bringing 3 
disease detections under one platform using the power of AI. Although these results are perfect yet an 
experiment we did, which can prove to be a revolution in the coming years. The main advantage of this 
project is that we can get the test results immediately at our home with a just few clicks.it is used to detect 
covid19 and pneumonia by using X-rays Images of chest and to detect Alzheimer we use MRI images. 
Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm for classification and it extract features from low to 
high levels. We use Convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish the brain MRI images of 
Alzheimer's disease from a normal and healthy brain. Importance of classification of This type of data is use 
to construct model or system for detecting symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and compared it with the 
normal subjects at various assessment stage. Classification of clinical data for illnesses like Alzheimer's 
disease It was a challenge, and the most problematic aspect every time. We have selected the most powerful 
and distinctive features by using CNN.
COVID19, going by the name of as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. It is a transmission 
able disease that is released from small droplets containing saliva and mucus from the respiratory tract of a 
sick person who is speaking, sneezing, or coughing that make you sick as well . It spreads rapidly by close 
contact with an infected person or by tapping or retaining the virus on contaminated objects or surfaces. 
Another infectious disease known as pneumonia is commonly caused by an infection caused by the bacteria 
in the alveoli
